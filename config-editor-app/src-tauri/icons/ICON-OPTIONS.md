# Icon Options

The actual Claude logo is quite complex. Here are 3 approaches:

## Option 1: Download Real Claude Logo + Add Speaker

**Best for**: Brand recognition

**Steps:**
1. Download official Claude SVG: https://uxwing.com/claude-ai-icon/
2. I'll overlay speaker waves on it
3. Most recognizable, but may be cluttered at small sizes

## Option 2: Simple "C" + Speaker Waves

**Best for**: Clean, minimal look

**What it is:**
- Bold "C" letter in Claude orange (#C15F3C)
- Speaker sound waves coming from the opening
- Clear and readable at all sizes

## Option 3: Just Use Claude Official Icon

**Best for**: Pure branding

**What it is:**
- Just the official Claude icon, no modifications
- Users will know it's Claude-related from context
- Cleanest option

## My Recommendation

For an app icon that needs to work at 16x16px all the way up to 512x512px, I'd suggest **Option 2** (Simple "C" + Speaker).

Why?
- ✅ Immediately recognizable as audio/sound related
- ✅ "C" clearly references Claude
- ✅ Works at tiny sizes
- ✅ Clean, modern look
- ✅ Uses Claude's brand color

Which would you prefer? Or should I download the actual Claude logo and try to combine it with speaker elements?
